- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Alex0101010101
- üëÄ I am interested in creating a new worldwide decentralized currency. Given that the highest hourly minimum wage listed on the USA Department of Labor
website is $15.2, I want to make it possible for anyone in the world to earn such finances. No one created the planet, it is common to all with its
resources and opportunities.
I have a website where it is written about it in more detail, I will post its name here later.
The development of my currency is unique and has no analogues. 
I have already realized that one of its variants can work based on P2P networks, but the computer processor will not be
a lot of work, it saves a lot of electricity. Any finances are not equal to human labor, and even the most expensive hundred billion dollar super computer
cannot be smarter than a human. this will be the case for another 50 years or more. our world will not become virtual soon, we have not invented
new technologies. Making a processor out of sand and comparing it to the human brain is stupid. Humans don't have transistors in their heads.
The brain is different and about 30% or less of its structure is known.
If a person has the skill to work, he should be able to get work done anywhere at American rates.
My decentralized, worldwide electronic currency provides such an opportunity. There are no poor people, there are people unable to pay you for your work.
Machine learning is when we train a computer to do like a human being, not when a computer teaches us how to talk to it. In the future, programs will be
created that understand human speech and gestures and will automatically translate
into machine code. It can be easier to create any kind of device. I am working on a program that will understand the human voice and gestures, the computer
will design any device and the human will tell it and show it what to do. This is the 5th industrial revolution. That way we can build technology to go to
other planets faster.
But first I have taken up the creation of a worldwide decentralized currency, this will give the opportunity to earn decent money and implement any plans



- üå± I study and invent, alternative energy, electric transportation, hydrogen fuel cells, electric aircraft, spacecraft, astronomy, planetary design, fast energy
efficient construction, repair, maintenance of computers, mobile technology, electronics development, bldc electric motors on neodymium magnets.
Now one of my projects is developing an affordable video card for distributed computing. I already know where to make it, it can be based on geforse 1650, 1660
technology and modernize it, add memory and change the PCB. There is a wiring diagram and full documentation on video cards, I want to upgrade and make more
affordable video cards, start producing in small batches, test the new cooling system. There are huge dumps of electronics on the planet, this can be used and
reduce carbon emissions. I am also interested in equipment to produce synthesis gas, gas, gasoline from wood, biomass, polluted air


- üíûÔ∏è I want to cooperate in any projects I told you about. Create my own company and recruit staff to work in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, England, USA.
I am also interested in repairing cars and trucks. It is interesting to organize cargo transportation. I already know where to get good used trucks for the company and any transportation. I need to unite with people who are also interested and get results. I want to make the system of delivery of people and goods more correct and reliable, and I already have the technical solutions.
First and most importantly, we start with the development of decentralized payment system, which will give the necessary influx of finances, investments, donations, sponsors assistance
